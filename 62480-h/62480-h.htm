<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2></div>

<p class="center">[From the <i>Princeton Alumni Weekly</i> of January 30, 1918.]</p>


<p>It is now seven weeks since the dispatches
from Paris reported that Stuart Walcott
was attacked by three German airplanes and
brought down behind the German lines, after he
himself had brought down a German plane in his
first combat on December 12, 1917, and that it
was feared he had been killed; but even now,
after the lapse of nearly two months, it is not
definitely known whether his fall proved fatal,
or whether the earnest hope of his friends that he
is still alive may be realized. The reports are
conflicting. A cable message of January 7 said
that in Germany it was reported that S. Walcott
had been killed by a fall on December 12 near
Saint Souplet; but Dr. Walcott received a letter
on January 19 which holds out some hope that
the fall was not fatal and that his son may be a
prisoner in Germany. This letter, dated December<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
17, is from a young aviator named Loughran,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
who was Stuart Walcott&#8217;s roommate at the flying
station. He gives this report of what was told
to him by an observer and pilot who saw the
combat:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;On the 12th of December at 11:30 a. m., there
were five pilots to go out on high patrol, including
Stuart and myself. But I was prevented
from going, because of a wrenched ankle. Stuart
and the other pilots left here at 11:40 a. m. for
high patrol, which means they are to fly above
the thousand metres. Two of the pilots had to
return because of motor trouble, leaving one pilot
whom Stuart was following.</p>

<p>&#8220;At 12:50 a. m. they ran across a German bi-place
machine. The French pilot attacked first,
but had to withdraw because of trouble with his
machine gun. He reports that the Spad [Stuart
Walcott&#8217;s machine], that had been following him,
he last saw a thousand metres above him, or the
German. Also that the German had gone back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
over his lines. The infantry and artillery observers
report the French pilot&#8217;s attack and combat.
And that six minutes later the German returned
over our lines. And that the Spad that was seen
flying at a very high altitude, came down and attacked
the German, and succeeded in bringing
him down in flames. In doing so he had to fly
quite a way over the German territory. And
that the Spad had started to return, when three
German fighting machines were seen diving on
him, and forcing him down. The Spad was last
seen doing a nose-dive perpendicular, behind
their lines. That is all the information I have
received up to date.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is what makes all the boys think that
Stuart is alive:</p>

<p>&#8220;A nose-dive perpendicular is used very often
in combat, but is very dangerous, as it is very
difficult for one to come out of and yet have their
motor running; that reason might force him to
land; also there was very little chance for him to
get away from them by flying, as they were
above, and the only sensible thing to do was to
land; and as we were only three days in this <i>secteur</i>,
the French think he might have been mixed
up as to the direction for home; or that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
slightly wounded and could not turn his machine
toward the French lines.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have tried every way possible to get information
about Stuart. I have sent the numbers
of his motor and machine to Major S. yros, who
is trying to trace it through the Red Cross service.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the French pilots of this <i>escadrille</i>,
who is a very good friend of your boy, shot down
a German biplane on 13th of December. The
machine fell behind our lines. The pilot was
dead before reaching the ground. But the observer
was only slightly wounded, so the boys of
that <i>escadrille</i> have asked the commander of the
group if we could be permitted to go and talk
to the German, as he may know something about
the Spad that fell behind his lines the day before.
We hope to know whether we will be permitted
to do so or not, tomorrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;It takes two months before we receive the report
from Germany officially. In the meantime
you will read all sorts of reports in the newspapers.
But I will cable or have Capt. Peter
Boal do so, if I get any news that is true.</p>

<p>&#8220;The case of Buckley, the American who fell
Sept. 5, was reported as being in flames from five
thousand metres down, and fell in German territory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
The observers reported that it landed on
its back and burned completely. His parents
were notified of his death; newspapers reported
the terrible death he died. Well, Sir, on November
25 we received a letter from him, saying
he was enjoying the best of health and was satisfied
with his surroundings in the prison camp in
Germany.</p>

<p>&#8220;So we are all hoping the same for Stuart.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have all Stuart&#8217;s personal things, and will
give them to Capt. Boal the first chance I get.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Walcott, it is beyond words for me to
try and tell you how grieved we all are about
Stuart, and how great a loss it is to the Escadrille,
for him to be away. He was more than
liked by every member and officer, and gave
promise of doing great things, was always up in
his machine trying to better himself in combat
flying; there never was a minute that he was idle,
if it was possible for him to fly. And never a
more generous and kinder boy. Only the night
before the patrol he last went out on, he gave me
every care in the world, got up during the night
to make sure I was comfortable and to do anything
he could for my ankle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>&#8220;From one who has been with Stuart through
all his training, and roommate on the Front,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">&#8220;Yours respectfully,</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">E. J. Loughran</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>This letter was written before the cable dispatch
of January 7, from the International Red
Cross, which seems to establish definitely the fact
that Stuart Walcott gave his life in support of
the endeavor to &#8220;make the world safe for democracy.&#8221;
In further and final evidence, a letter
dated February 5, 1918, informed Dr. Walcott
that the Red Cross agent in Paris had reported
&#8220;Stuart Walcott&#8217;s grave has been found.&#8221; An
accompanying map from Loughran shows that
the spot where Stuart Walcott fell is on a hill a
little South of Saint Souplet.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Benjamin Stuart Walcott was of New England
ancestry. His earliest known American
forbear was Capt. Jonathan Walcott of Salem,
Mass., 1663-1699. Later, one of Capt. Jonathan&#8217;s
descendants, Benjamin Stuart Walcott,
served in a Rhode Island regiment during the
Revolutionary War. On his mother&#8217;s side two
ancestors served in the Continental Army and in
the Revolutionary War.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">FROM PRINCETON TO FRANCE</h2></div>


<p>Stuart Walcott was a senior at Princeton
in the winter of 1916-17. In view of his approaching
graduation in the spring his father
wrote to him that he had best begin to think about
what he was to do after graduation in order that
he might get on an independent basis as soon as
practicable. In response under date of January
7, 1917, he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;You spoke of my being independent after I
graduate in the spring. If I go to Europe, as
I want to, to drive an ambulance or in the aeroplane
I will be doing a man&#8217;s work and shall be
doing enough to support myself. If the work is
unpaid, it is merely because it is charitable work
and as such is given freely. If you want to pay
my way, I will consider it not as dependence on
you, father, but as a partnership that may help
the Allies and their cause. I will furnish my services
and you the funds to make my services
available. If not, I will be willing to invest the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
small amount of capital which has accumulated in
my name. I have been thinking of this work in
Europe for over a year now, and am still very
strong for it. I don&#8217;t know what the effect will
be on myself, but if it will be of service to others,
I think that it is something I ought to do.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Being assured that the expenses would be provided
for, he then began an investigation as to
the best method of procedure to obtain training
as an aviator. In a letter dated January 26 he
said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Many, many thanks for sending me the book
on the French Flying Corps by Winslow. I read
half of it the night that it came and stayed up
late last night to finish it. He gives a very
straight, interesting and apparently not exaggerated
account of the work over there, which has
made it somewhat clearer to me, just what it is
that I want to get into. Now I am even more
anxious than I was before to join the service over
there. The more that I think about it and the
more that I hear of it, the more desirous I am of
getting into the Flying Corps. If a man like
Winslow with a wife and daughter dependent on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
him is willing to take the risk involved, I see no
reason why I should not.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mention the Ambulance service in your
last note. I have thought of that quite a little
and would definitely prefer the aviation. The
ambulance is worth while, I think, in that it gives
one an opportunity to be of great service to humanity,
but not so much so as the other. There
will be a number of my classmates who will enlist
in the American Ambulance this spring, but
the air service appeals to me.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>He then made arrangements with the American
representatives of the Lafayette Escadrille
to go to France on the completion of his college
year. On January 29 he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;I will get a physical examination in a few
days. In regard to getting the training over
here first, I do not think that it would be worth
while. The instruction over there would be first
hand, bright, for a definite purpose and on the
whole superior to what I could get here. I could
also be picking up the language and the hang of
the country at the same time.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>On February 24 he received word that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
papers presented with his application for admittance
to the Franco-American Flying Corps assured
him on their face of a welcome when he
presented himself in Paris. He was informed
that if he utilized his spare time in availing himself
of any and every opportunity to familiarize
himself with flying, it would shorten his stay in
the Student Aviators School in France. On
March 26 he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t been able to find out anything definite
about the school at Mineola. As yet, no
change has been announced to my knowledge, in
reference to hastening up the course in event of
the coming of war. Over a hundred men have
left college [Princeton] already to start training
for the Mosquito Fleet, and the rest of them are
drilling every afternoon. What do you think of
the advisability of stopping college and going to
some aviation school? Considering that it takes
several months to become at all useful as an aviator
and that war is practically inevitable now,
I think it would be wise to get started right
away.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>And again, on April 3:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;I saw in the morning paper that the American
fliers in France would be transferred to
American registry immediately after the declaration
of war. When you next see General
Squier, I wish that you would sound him on the
probability of a force being sent to France to
learn to fly according to French methods. That
is the one thing above all others that I want to
get into. If there is any chance of that I do not
want to get involved in anything else....</p>

<p>&#8220;It is quite certain that seniors who leave college
now, to go into military work, will receive
their degrees. I would not object to losing the
work as it is not my present intention to keep on
with theoretical chemistry and that is what I am
devoting my time to this spring. From the
standpoint of education alone, I think that my
time could be more profitably spent in the study
of aviation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Leave was granted by the University, and on
April 6 Stuart Walcott was appointed a special
assistant to Mr. Sidney D. Waldon, Inspector
of Aeroplanes and Aeroplane Motors, Signal
Service at Large. He immediately reported to
Mr. Waldon and worked with him through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
April. May first he went to Newport News,
Virginia. May 2 he reported:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;My first trip up was this afternoon with Victor
Carlstrom. We were out 16 minutes and
climbed 3,500 feet. It was all very simple getting
up there&mdash;a little wind and noise and some
bumps and pockets in the air&mdash;a glorious view of
the Harbor. Then we started to come down.
First, I saw the earth directly below through the
planes on the left. Then the horizon made a sudden
wild lurch and Newport News appeared directly
below on my right. This continued for a
little while and then we started down at an angle
of about 30 degrees to the perpendicular, turning
as we went. I later learned that Carlstrom
had executed a few steep banks or sharp turns
and then spiralled down. It ended with a very
pretty landing, following with a series of banks
to check speed. Flying from my first impression
is a very fascinating game and the one I want to
stay with for a while. I have signed up for 100
minutes in the air. While this hundred minutes
will not make me a flier by any means I think it
is well worth the while in that it gives me a little

July 4, 1917.</p>

<p>Dear H&mdash;&mdash;:</p>

<p>... My work here is going well, although
slowly. Those in my class ought to get out by
October if nothing goes wrong. There are some
150 Americans learning to fly now in France,
besides the ones the Government may have sent
over&mdash;more than a hundred at this one school,
and the oddest combination I&#8217;ve ever been thrown
with: chauffeurs, second-story men, ex-college
athletes, racing drivers, salesmen, young bums of
leisure, a colored prize fighter, ex-Foreign Légionnaires,
ball players, millionaires and tramps.
Not too good a crowd according to most standards,
but the worst bums may make the best
aviators. There&#8217;s plenty of need for all of them.</p>

<p>There are lots of Frenchmen here also and a
big crowd of Russians, mostly happy youngsters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
having a very good time. They&#8217;re always in a
hurry to get up in the air and are continually
breaking machines and their necks. The Americans
have an endless streak of luck in being able
to fall out of the air and collect themselves uninjured
from amidst a pile of kindling wood
which was the machine. As yet I haven&#8217;t done
any piloting in the air, so can&#8217;t talk very wisely
about the glories and thrills of slipping through
the ephemeral clouds. All I have learned is that
almost any kind of a dub can be a pilot, but that
there aren&#8217;t a lot of very good ones. The idea is
to get enough practice to become a good one before
arguing with the elusive Boche at a high
altitude.</p>

<p>It looks over here as though there would be
about two years more of war, judging from what
most people say. It is to be hoped that after
twelve to eighteen months we will be able to take
France&#8217;s place at the front, for she deserves to
be relieved and will have to be. Even now,
France is almost spent; it will be England and
the United States who will finish the war. This
war is a terrible thing, but for America it is an
opportunity as well. I am glad that we have at
last come into it and that it will be no half-way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
fight that we must put up. The Canadians have
been about the best regiments in the war. Why
shouldn&#8217;t America be as good?...</p>

<p>You see it&#8217;s Friday, the thirteenth, my lucky
day, and I&#8217;m happy because the work is going
well. First, I&#8217;ll tell you about a smash I had a
week or so ago.</p>

<p>The roller or <i>Rouleur</i> class which I smashed in
has the same machine as those that fly with a 45
P motor. Only it is throttled down, and we are
supposed to keep it on the ground&mdash;just about
ready to fly, but not quite getting up&mdash;a speed
of about 30 m.p.h. When there is the slightest
wind we can not roll, because the wind turns the
tail around and swings the machine in a circle&mdash;a
wooden horse&mdash;<i>cheval de bois</i>. I rode about
the end of the list Saturday&mdash;and the wind had
come up as the day got on. Work stops at 8:30
a. m. always because there&#8217;s too much wind. My
first sortie or trip went O.K. with a considerable
breeze on the tail, but on the second there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
too much wind and after I got going pretty fast&mdash;around
she went. The wind caught under the
inside wing and up it went. Smash went the
outside wheel, and a crackle of busting wood.
All the front framework of wood that holds the
motor was smashed&mdash;a pretty bad break. The
monitor was a bit mad and talked to me a bit in
French.</p>

<p>The next morning I was called in to see the
chief of the Blériot school, Lt. de Chavannes, a
very nice officer. He told me that my monitor
was not satisfied with me&mdash;that he had told me
to do something (cut the motor when the machine
started to turn) three separate times, and
that each time I had intentionally disobeyed, that
if anything like that happened again I would be
radiated (discharged from the school). That
was quite the first I had ever heard of it and I
was so mad at the monitor that I could have
kicked him in the head. I tried to explain to the
Lieutenant but he never heard a word, so I just
gurgled with wrath and didn&#8217;t do anything. But
yesterday we got another monitor who is a different
sort.</p>

<p>The class after <i>rouleur</i> is <i>decollé</i>&mdash;it is the
same machine, but one gets off the ground about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
a metre or two, then slacks up on the motor and
settles to the earth. It is strictly forbidden to
<i>decollé</i> in the <i>rouleur</i> class. This morning I had
a sortie in the <i>rouleur</i> and all of a sudden noticed
that I was in the air a bit&mdash;managed to keep it
straight and get out of the air without smashing.
The monitor said nothing so I <i>decolléed</i> on all
the sorties. When I got out the monitor explained
that it was strictly forbidden to go off the
ground in the <i>rouleur</i> class, that I shouldn&#8217;t have
done it, and then asked me if I would like to go
up to the other class. Whereupon consenting, I
am now in the <i>decollé</i> class, leaving sixteen
rather peeved Americans who arrived in the
<i>rouleur</i> the same time I did, who can perform in
the <i>rouleur</i> quite as well as I can and who will
remain in the <i>rouleur</i> for some time yet. They&#8217;ve
no grudge against me, however, as it was only a
streak of luck on my part. Later in the morning
I had some sorties in the <i>decolleur</i> and got up
two or three metres. The wind was too strong,
so my trips were a bit rough, but nothing was
damaged&mdash;so hurrah for Friday, the thirteenth.</p>

<h3>III</h3>


<p class="right">July 17, 1917.</p>

<p>The work has been going very well since last I
wrote you, which was only two or three days ago.
I told you about at last leaving the blessed roller;
I never was so relieved in my life. The first
evening in the <i>decollé</i> class, I was requisitioned
to turn tails and the morning after there was too
much wind to work. The <i>decollé</i> is the one
where you go up two or three metres and settle
down by cutting speed. The first time I had
three sorties in the wind, bounced around a lot,
but did no damage. The next time was first
thing in the morning. Two metres up on the
first, four or five on the fifth&mdash;strictly against
orders. I even had to <i>piqué</i>&mdash;point the machine
toward the ground&mdash;a little, which is not at all
<i>comme il faut</i> in the <i>decollé</i>. But these Frenchmen
are funny chaps&mdash;sometimes they will get
terribly angry and punish one for disobeying,
and again they will be tickled to death with it.
If I had smashed while doing more than I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
told to, there would have been a lot of trouble;
as it was, no objection&mdash;and the monitor personally
conducted me to the <i>piqué</i> class with a
very nice recommendation.</p>

<p>Now there are two <i>piqué</i> classes: one with a
<i>piste</i> about a quarter of a mile long, in which one
is supposed to do little more than <i>decollé</i>, get up
about five metres and <i>piqué un tout petit peu</i>&mdash;hardly
at all. After comes the advanced <i>piqué</i>
with a much longer <i>piste</i> on which one can get
up 100 metres (300 feet). On my first sortie in
the <i>piqué</i>, I was told to roll on the ground all the
way, so continuing my policy, did a low <i>decollé</i>.
Next I was supposed to do a two metre <i>decollé</i>,
so went up ten and <i>piquéd</i>. Had ten sorties in
that class one morning, getting as high as I
could&mdash;about twenty metres&mdash;and went to the advanced
<i>piqué</i> that night&mdash;last night. Four sorties
there last night with a machine with a poor
motor, so didn&#8217;t get up over a hundred feet.</p>

<p>And this morning I did my first real aviating.
There was a bit of wind blowing, so the monitor,
Mr. Moses, only let a Lieutenant and me go up,
as we had gone better than the others last night.
First it was a bit rainy and always bumpy as the
deuce&mdash;air puffs and pockets which require the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
entire corrective force of the wing warp and rudder
to overcome. My last sortie was decidedly
active. The wind had developed into a bit of a
breeze which is to a Blériot like a rough sea to a
row boat. Two or three times I got a puff that
tipped the machine &#8217;way over&mdash;put the controls
over as far as I could and waited. It seemed a
minute before she straightened. The trouble was
that the machine was climbing and therefore not
going very fast. If I had <i>piquéd</i>, it would have
corrected quicker. I had no trouble at all in
making the landing. Hopping out of the machine,
I saw the head monitor rushing over to
Mr. Moses on the double, shouting volubly in
French and berating him severely. I gathered
that he had been watching my manoeuvres, expecting
something to fall every instant, and that
he strenuously objected to Moses&#8217; letting me go
up. Work stopped there for the morning, and it
was very fully explained to me what the trouble
was. If I have some sorties there tonight, I go
to <i>Tour de Piste</i> (Flying Field) in the morning.
I may be on Nieuport in two weeks.</p>

<p>I am now beginning to see the advantages of
the Blériot training. There is a great deal of
preliminary work on or near the ground. In all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
other aviation training, such as at Newport News,
90 per cent of the work is in making landings&mdash;in
piquéing down, redressing at the proper moment
and making gradual connections with the earth.
I haven&#8217;t made a really bad landing yet and the
reason is that I have been in a machine so much
on and near the ground, that I have sort of developed
a sense or feel of it, and almost automatically
redress correctly, and settle easily.
Also I can tell pretty closely what is flying speed
because of the work on the rollers. It&#8217;s the same
way with all the other students only I know it
now from my own experience.</p>

<p>And this morning I began to realize that my
hundred minutes at Newport News was invaluable.
I not only found out some of the tricks of
a master hand (Carlstrom) but also developed a
bit of confidence in the air, and air sense, without
which I could have got into trouble this morning.
My bumpy ride this morning is absolutely
invaluable. I&#8217;ll probably never have so much
trouble in the air again, because a fast machine
or even a Blériot with a good motor, would hardly
have noticed these puffs. It was a bit risky,
I guess, or the head monitor would not have been
worried, but now that it&#8217;s over, I know a lot
more.</p>

<p class="right">August 11, 1917.</p>

<p>Dear &mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>:</p>

<p>You have certainly developed into a wonderful
correspondent. Honest-to-goodness, a letter
you started my way about a month ago was quite
the most satisfactory and amusing thing I&#8217;ve received
since I&#8217;ve been over here. Based on practically
no material, yet it was alive with interest,
every line. There&#8217;s nothing like a finishing
school education. If I thought that you could
knit, I would immediately appoint you as my
<i>marraine</i> (godmother), for it&#8217;s quite possible for
one person to have more than one soldier and I
am but a soldier of the second class in the French
Army. As I understand it, the chief duty of a
<i>marraine</i> is to write letters&mdash;you&#8217;ve started that
in good style&mdash;and to knit wool scarfs, which the
devoted soldier hands to a French peasant woman
to unravel and make a pair of socks out
of....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>Many Yale boys have wandered in upon us of
late, Alan Winslow, Wally Winter, George
Mosely, and others. Also Chester Bassett, late
of Washington and Harvard University, who I
believe has the good fortune to be acquainted
with you, a very recommendable young man.
They tell me that Cord Meyer is aviating at some
camp nearby, but, not having any machines, they
have to spend their time touring the country in
a high powered motor.</p>

<p>Had a long and gossipy letter from Pat the
other day, containing details of many weddings
and engagements, even unto young &mdash;&mdash;
&mdash;&mdash;. All my classmates are doing the same
stunt. How about being original and waiting
until the war is over and seeing who of the competitors
are left? I quite expect to be, but it&#8217;s
luck I&#8217;m trusting to; there&#8217;s a lot of war left in
the nations of Europe. One never can tell; I
may come home on permission in a French uniform
with a wing on my collar.... When the
American Air Service is a little further along, it
may be that we will be taken over from the
French Army.</p>

<p>I finished up in one division of the school the
other day and passed to another for brevet, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
tests for a military aviator. I sort of have the
impression that I wrote you a few weeks ago
about it, but not being sure, run the risk of repetition,
which, if any, I hope you will excuse.
This epistle is being written out at the <i>piste</i> (flying
field), waiting for the wind to drop enough
to fly, and with me seated amidst a bunch of Russians,
so if there are any superfluous &#8220;iskis&#8221; or
&#8220;ovitches&#8221; in this, you will understand why. The
Russians are great fliers; in fact they know so
much about it that they never listen to their monitors
and as a result break more machines than all
the other pupils combined. A month ago five of
them went to the next school for acrobacy and in
a week every one of them had killed himself. I
pulled a bit of the same Russian stuff in the
spiral class of the Blériot. All the work is solo&mdash;never
a flight double command so one has to get
instructions on the ground and follow them in
the air.</p>

<p>I used my head and senses in performing my
first spiral, instead of shutting my eyes, doing
what I had been told and trusting to God. The
result was that I made one more turn than I expected
to and that quite perpendicular, not at all
<i>comme il faut</i> in a Blériot. Why something did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
not break has been the wonder of the Blériot
school. But nothing did and we got down all
right. Another time I planted a cuckoo on her
nose, which is not at all encouraged by the monitors.
&#8217;Tis quite a trick to balance a monoplane
on its nose on the ground, but I did it&mdash;quite
vertical she lay, with me in the middle struggling
with the safety belt and wondering which way it
was going to fall. My final appearance in the
Blériot school was likewise spectacular. The
left wing hit a hole in the air which the right one
didn&#8217;t. Naturally things tipped; then they
wouldn&#8217;t straighten and the only thing to do was
to dive to the low side. I did, but forgot to shut
off the motor. A very steep and fast spiral resulted
in which I lost 500 feet in a half-turn in
about two seconds, I think, all with the motor
going to beat the cars. I must have been travelling
at many hundreds of miles an hour. Once
again nothing broke, but it was no fault of mine
that it didn&#8217;t....</p>

<h3>V</h3>


<p class="right">August 25, 1917.</p>

<p>I started for my altitude test three days ago.
The requirement is one hour above 2,000 metres.
I got to 1,950 metres and one cylinder refused to
fire, so I was forced to come down. The next
morning I tried again, got to 900 metres and the
magneto ceased to function, thereby stopping all
progress. I glided toward home, but didn&#8217;t have
quite the height to make the <i>piste</i>, so had to land
in a nearby field, just dodging a potato patch.
A flock of curious sheep came around and carefully
examined the machine, getting considerably
mixed up in the wires of the open tail construction
and leaving considerable wool thereon.
When the mechanics eventually got the motor
going, I started off, didn&#8217;t get quite in the air
before the motor went bad and then I ran into
a bean patch, gathering about a bushel of beans
with the same tail wires. Yesterday morning I
tried again, climbed to 2,000 in fourteen minutes
and to 3,500 metres (11,500 feet) in forty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
minutes. I went up through some light clouds
and when I got to 3,500, the top of my recording
barograph, more clouds had formed and I was
practically shut off from the earth, nothing but a
beautiful sea of clouds below me, a very beautiful
sight. One other machine was in sight, far below
me, but on top of the clouds. Not wanting to get
lost I came down through the clouds and stayed
out my hour just above 2,000 and below the
clouds, where the air was very much churned up,
keeping me very busy. Just as soon as the time
was up I came down with a pair of very chilled
feet, making the 2,000 metres in five minutes to
the ground. No work since then on account of
bad weather.</p>

<p>This morning I attended my first Catholic
funeral, that of the commandant of the school
who was the victim of a mid-air collision, a very
unusual accident. The other machine got down
safely though badly smashed. Everybody in
camp attended the funeral in the chapel of the
Artillery Camp next door. I understood none
of the service, but the music by a tenor and a
&#8217;cello was excellent. While the cortege was going
down the hill to the cemetery, a Nieuport
circled overhead very low for half an hour or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
more and dropped a wreath. It was a very impressive
ceremony.</p>

<p>I expect to start on triangle and <i>petit voyage</i>
in a few days. When they are done, I will be a
breveted flier in the French Army. Then comes
<i>perfectionné</i> work and acrobacy, so it will be quite
a while yet for me.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>


<p class="right">August 31, 1917.</p>

<p>Dear &mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>:</p>

<p>Here it is almost September and I am still a
dog-goned <i>élève pilote</i>. Verily, every time I
think of how the time passes along without results,
I go wild. My complaint is caused by the
west wind, which has blown about twenty-five
days during the month of August and seems
likely to continue well on into September. The
only variety is an occasional storm. For the past
two weeks I&#8217;ve been waiting to start my voyages,
two trips to a town forty miles away and back
and two other triangular trips about 180 miles
long each. When they are done, one becomes a
<i>pilote élève</i>; and there&#8217;s a great if subtle difference
when the words are reversed. An <i>élève
pilote</i> is the scum of the earth, looked down on
by mechanics, pilots, monitors, and everyone else;
a <i>pilote élève</i> can wear wings on his collar and is
as good as any one else. He is permitted to fly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
in rough weather, to take chances and is not in
so much danger of getting radiated if he gets in
trouble. The proper thing to do on a triangle or
<i>petit voyage</i> is to have something bust directly
over a nice château; make a skilful landing on the
front lawn under the eyes of the admiring household
and then be an enforced guest for a few
days until one is rescued by a truck and mechanics.
One has to be very careful where the <i>panne
de moteur</i> catches him lest he have to make his
landing in a lake or on a forest, which is apt to
be a bit awkward. One chap, an American, has
been out on a triangle for two weeks, staying at
some country place, and there are four others at
another school near a big town waiting for
weather to return. Reports give us to believe
they are having a much better time there than we
are here.</p>

<p>Between here and the point for the <i>petit voyage</i>&mdash;a
little bit off the route, is the big future
American aviation camp and also an Artillery
camp. There are quite a bunch of fellows there,
Quentin Roosevelt, Cord Meyer, etc., I think.
Every American that has left on his voyages in
the last month has stopped there against all orders
and been bawled out by the monitor. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
has to keep a recording barometer or altimeter
machine, a barograph, during the voyages, which
indicates all stops. One chap came back home
the other day with a barometer record showing
beyond the shadow of a doubt that he had made a
stop of about fifteen minutes <i>en route</i>. The
monitor saw it, said, &#8220;<i>Alors</i>, all you Americans
stop off there, I don&#8217;t like it.&#8221; Then the chap
tried to explain how he had had a <i>panne</i> and
come down in a field out in the country somewhere,
fixed the motor and come on home. He
almost got away with it, but the monitor happened
to snook around a bit and noticed on the
tail very clearly written a good Anglo-Saxon
name, the name of the town, and the date&mdash;quite
indisputable evidence. I fully expect to have a
<i>panne</i> there myself before long.</p>

<p>By the way, to declare a short pause in my
chronicle of aviation, how about all those &#8220;letters
that are to follow&#8221;? If you try to tell me how
good you are to your Belgian soldier, I refuse to
believe a word until you treat me in the same
way. And I also refuse to accept anyone as a
<i>marraine</i> (isn&#8217;t that what you call these fairy
godmother persons one is supposed to correspond
with during the war and marry afterward?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
How inconsiderate some of them are, to take
three or four soldiers, just assuming that not
more than one will survive; however, they may be
wise to have more than one iron in the fire. But
my parenthesis grows apace.)&mdash;I say I refuse a
<i>marraine</i> until she approves her ability. But
let me see again. Does said <i>marraine</i> have to be
a complete stranger? It seems to me that is customary,
and also usually they are of different
nationalities. All of the foregoing weak line will
be interpreted as a mere plea for that other letter.
I&#8217;ve never made this &#8220;absence makes the
heart grow fonder&#8221; stuff at all. Even &mdash;&mdash;
has given me up; I remain to her only another
of the forgotten conquests (?) of the dead past....</p>

<p>This odd person, Bassett, wandered in all
dressed up like a patch of blue sky and I just
had to let you know he was here. With absolute
confidence in each other&#8217;s integrity, we put our
loving messages side by each. By the way, he <i>is</i>
a good scout, don&#8217;t you think? I have gotten to
like him immensely since he has been here. I
never had a better time in my life than one evening
in Paris with Chet. However quiet the
party, he is the life of it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>It must be that I take my weekly shave&mdash;in
cold, cold water, with a dull, dull razor. Oh,
happy thought! Tell the father and brothers
hello from me. Also tell &mdash;&mdash; to drop me a
line of what he&#8217;s doing and when he&#8217;s coming
over.</p>

<p>The wild man in the Nieuport was out again
this morning giving some one a joy ride. There
is a long straight stretch of road in front of our
<i>piste</i> and he came down that several times, a
nasty puffy wind blowing which bothered him
not at all, flying only two or three feet off the
ground. In front of the <i>piste</i> is a telephone wire
crossing the road. He came along the road 100
miles an hour until almost on top of the wire and
jumped up just in time to clear it by a few feet&mdash;really
beautiful work. He goes all over the surrounding
country flying low, hopping over trees
and houses, sometimes turning up sideways to
slip between two trees a bit too close together to
fly through; sometimes dragging a wing through
the space between a couple of hangars or doing
vertical <i>virages</i> just in front of them. It doesn&#8217;t
seem possible that any man can be so much a part
of his machine, can be so consistently accurate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
that he never misses. For this chap, Lumière,
has never had a smash....</p>

<p>A chap named Loughran started off on one of
his brevet voyages a few days before I got ready
for brevet. He got quite a ways along, ran into
a storm, went above it, got caught in a cloud,
kept on for quite a long way being drifted by a
strong wind, then came down through the clouds
and found that they were only 400 feet above the
ground. After a while he found a place to land
and came down safely. He went to a farmhouse,
got his machine guarded and tied down. In the
meantime word had spread over the countryside
that an aviator had come down there and the entire
population came out to look him over. A
grand equipage drove up with a Count who lived
in a nearby château. He insisted that Eddie
come to the château and accept their hospitality.
There the fortunate Ed stayed five days; the
Countess talked English, and also some house
guests. He hadn&#8217;t brought a trunk so borrowed
razor, etc., from the Count; went down to see the
machine every day in the baronial barouche.
Whenever he went to the little town in the vicinity
all the kids followed him around the streets
and when at last he left, he was presented with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
multitude of bouquets and had to kiss each and
every donor. He brought back pictures of the
château&mdash;a delightful looking old place&mdash;and numerous
addresses.</p>

<h3>VIII</h3>


<p class="right">September 4, 1917.</p>

<p>At last the two weeks of wind and rain has
ceased and now it is perfect weather&mdash;a bit of a
breeze and lots of sun for the last two days.
Yesterday morning there weren&#8217;t enough machines
to go around so I did not work, making
the eighth consecutive day I hadn&#8217;t stepped in a
machine. Last evening I at last and with much
rejoicing started out on my &#8220;maiden voyage&#8221; to
another school about 60 kilometres away (37.5
miles). It was delightfully easy&mdash;nothing to do
but climb two or three thousand feet and just sit
there and watch the country unfold, comparing
the maplike surface of the earth spread out below
with the map in the machine. In good weather it
is very easy to follow, spot roads, towns, woods,
rivers and bridges. Railroad tracks get lost at
high altitudes and are harder to find anyway.
One has to keep an eye open for a place to land
within gliding distance in case of a <i>panne</i> always,
but the country is so flat and so much cultivated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
around here that it is absurdly simple. I endeavored
always to keep some pleasant looking
house or château in range in case of trouble, for
the French are proverbially hospitable to aviators
<i>en panne</i> (lying to, descending).</p>

<p>Coming back yesterday evening, the sun was
pretty low and the air absolutely calm, nothing
but the drone of the motor and the wind; the only
movements necessary an occasional slight pressure
on the joy stick to one side or the other to
keep the proper direction. I came very nearly
going to sleep, it was so peaceful up there; several
times closed my eyes and swayed a bit. As
a matter of fact one is perfectly safe at that altitude&mdash;anything
over a thousand feet&mdash;because
the machine, at least this particular type, won&#8217;t
get into any position from which one cannot get
it out within 200 metres at most. But nevertheless
I haven&#8217;t tried any impromptu falls as yet.</p>

<p>This morning I repeated the same identical
performance, because for some reason we have to
do two <i>petits voyages</i>, and had much the same
kind of a time as yesterday. On the way home
one cylinder quit its job and threw oil instead,
covering me from head to foot and clouding up
my goggles so I had to wipe them off about every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
minute. When I got back the mechanics decided
that that motor had died of old age and would
have to be repaired, so I am again without a
machine. Have watched a beautiful afternoon
pass by from the barracks when without my luck
I&#8217;d be working. But with a machine and weather,
I can be finished tomorrow; two triangles
to do about 200 kilometres (125 miles) each and
I can do one in the morning and the other in the
evening and then I&#8217;m breveted. Perhaps by day
after tomorrow I&#8217;ll start <i>perfectionné</i> on Nieuport.
I hope so.</p>

<h3>IX</h3>


<p class="right">September 9, 1917.</p>

<p>Since my last to Father, I have had some very
interesting times. First, I finished my <i>brevet</i>
with very little excitement, made all my voyages
and only got lost a little bit once. Then I saw
two machines on the ground in a field, made a
rather dramatic spiral and steeply banked descent
amidst a crowd of villagers and got away with it;
then found that the machines belonged to two
monitors who were bringing them from Paris and
had effected a <i>panne de château</i>. Being asked
what I was doing, I fortunately found a spark
plug on the burn and got that repaired. The
rest of it was very easy, a bit of flying in the rain
which stings the face a bit, but is not bad otherwise.</p>

<p>Since I have been on the Nieuport. There are
three sizes of machines on which one is trained,
starting with the larger double command and going
to the smallest. At Pau, we get another even
smaller, about as big as half-a-minute. Four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
times I went out without a ride&mdash;bad weather,
crowded class and busted machines, the same old
story. Then last night I had my first rides with
a monitor who is rather oldish, crabbed and new
at his job, a brand new aviator. As you know,
when an airplane takes a turn, it does not remain
horizontal but banks up: <i>comme ça</i> (if you can
interpret that illustration&mdash;it shows signs of remarkable
imaginative power)&mdash;<i>alors</i>, one banks
to take a turn and uses the rudder only a very
little because the machine turns along when
banked. There is a sort of falling-out feeling the
first few times until one becomes a part of the
machine.</p>

<p>To get back to the story, this monitor does not
like to bank his machine and sort of sidles round
the corners, keeping it quite flat and almost slipping
out to the outside of the turn. I have done
many fool things in a machine and made many
mistakes, but never have I been so scared in anything
in my life as when riding with this monitor.
A monitor is supposed to let the pupil drive as
much as he is able, but this bird never let me
make a move, and when we got through told me
I was too brutal. I was never madder in my life
and cursed nice American cuss words all the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
home. There&#8217;s a fifteen kilo ride in a seatless
tractor back to camp to improve a bad humor.</p>

<p>Well, this morning I saw some more rides impending
and didn&#8217;t like it, so asked the <i>chef de
piste</i> to put me with another monitor. He had
to know why and I registered my kick, which
practically said that the first monitor didn&#8217;t know
his business and couldn&#8217;t drive, that I was scared
to ride with him. The <i>chef</i> was a bit sarcastic
and told me to take two rides with another monitor
to show how <i>I</i> could make a <i>virage</i>. I did it
the way I&#8217;ve been accustomed to, made a fairly
short turn; when we got down, the monitor said
&#8220;<i>Epatant</i>&#8221; (Am. &#8220;stunning&#8221;) or something like
that to the <i>chef</i>. The <i>chef</i> had meanwhile communicated
my complaint to the first monitor and
he was the maddest man I ever saw. Demanded
what &#8220;<i>Ce type là</i>&#8221; (indicating me) wanted, said
the <i>virages</i> I had just made were dangerously
banked (the monitor I was with didn&#8217;t mind,
though) and then all three started arguing at
once at me and I spelled all the French I knew.
About that time I thought of what you had just
told me in a letter about trusting in Latin, which
advice and remarks I have come to agree with
very much (my admiration for the French has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
waxed less daily), and here I realized that I had
very successfully made a fool out of a man who
was supposed to be my teacher, and he fully resented
it.</p>

<p>Then, of all things, the lieutenant, without further
remarks, said I was to continue with my
first monitor. My heart sank into my feet. I
had visions of staying in that class without rides
or with only rides and fights for months; I rode
no more this morning and what was my delight
to find this evening that my bewhiskered pal had
left on permission. I got another monitor, a fine
one who put his hands on the side of the machine
and let me do everything with a bit of assistance
on the landing, which is different from what I&#8217;ve
been doing on the Caudron. Seven rides and a
finish&mdash;the twenty-three-metre tomorrow morning.
I wasn&#8217;t very good, but got by.</p>

<p>Things for me are going all right. Have made
progress on the Nieuport since last I wrote and
will fly alone soon. As regards the U. S. Army,
things are at a standstill until I get to Paris
which will be a week or so. I hope to go to the
front in a French <i>escadrille</i> and in an American
uniform. Some say it can be done; some that it
cannot. It sounds so sensible that I am afraid
there must be some regulation against it.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>




<h3>XI</h3>


<p class="right">September 27, 1917.</p>

<p>Since last I wrote a regular letter, considerable
has taken place. First, I am now at Pau, having
finished up Avord. Have sent postcards to
Father right along to keep track of movements.
After <i>brevet</i> was over, I did not take the customary
permission of forty-eight hours, but went
straight to work on Nieuport, D. C. (double
command). One cannot learn a great deal riding
with an instructor&mdash;only about enough to
keep from smashing in landing, because one
never knows when the instructor is messing with
the controls, when it&#8217;s one&#8217;s self. There are five
kinds of Nieuports&mdash;differing mainly in size, the
smaller being faster and more agile in the air,
better adapted to eccentric flying. They are 28,
23, 18, 15, 13 (the baby Nieuport). At Avord
I had about a week of D. C. on 28 and 23 (the
numbers refer to size of wings) with several days
of no work. Then some days on 23 alone and
finally on 18 alone.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>The landings are a bit different from those of
the machines I had been flying as they are faster
and the machines are quite nose-heavy. In the
air the nose-heavy feature makes them &#8220;fly themselves&#8221;&mdash;that
is, according to the speed of the
motor the machine will rise and climb or <i>piqué</i>
and descend, with never a touch from the pilot.
If the weather is not very bad, the Nieuport will
correct itself automatically from all displacements.
But in landing the nose-heavy feature
causes a great many <i>capotages</i>. If the landing
isn&#8217;t done about right with the tail low&mdash;over she
goes on her nose or all the way onto her back. It
is a very common occurrence and has become almost
a joke. When a pupil capotes, everybody
kids him&mdash;no one hurries over to see if he is hurt,
not at all; he climbs out from under, usually
cursing, and in ten minutes the truck is out to
salvage the wreck.</p>

<p>It is astounding the way smashes are taken as
a matter of course. Yesterday one chap in landing
hit another machine, demolishing both but
not touching either pilot. Being worth some
$15,000 or $25,000, but no one seemed to worry&mdash;it&#8217;s
very much a matter of course. The monitor
was a little peeved because he will be short of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
machines for a few days, but that was all. I&#8217;ve
seen as many as ten machines flat on their backs
or with tails high in the air, on one field at the
same time. For myself, I haven&#8217;t capoted or
busted any wood since the Blériot days. But
I&#8217;m knocking on the wooden table now. On several
occasions it has been only luck that saved me,
as I&#8217;ve made many rotten landings.</p>

<p>Well, to get back to the diary. After finishing
at Avord, I waited around for two days to
get papers fixed up, requested and obtained permission
and then decided not to use it and left
straight for Pau after fond farewells to the
friends I&#8217;ve been with for three and a half
months. Looking back, I didn&#8217;t have such a bad
time at Avord after all, though I did get terribly
tired of the living conditions.</p>

<p>My trip to Pau I put down to experience. I
discovered one schedule not to travel by in future.
Leaving Avord at 2:15 I got to Bourges
at 2:45 and found that the train left at 7:29.
Fortunately, there was another chap from the
school on the train, Arthur Bluthenthal, an old
Princeton football star, whom I have gotten to
know quite well, so we managed to waste the afternoon
together. At 7:29 I started another half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
hour&#8217;s journey, at the end of which the timetable
said that the train for Bordeaux left at 10:30
(this is all P. M.).</p>

<p>At this town there were some American engineers,
so I embraced the fellow countrymen in a
strange land. Finished up a not very gay evening
by attending the movies, a most odd institution.
Clouds of tobacco smoke obscured the
screen, and most of the action was around the
bar at one side of the hall. Nobody was drunk,
but nearly every one was drinking and very gay.
This was merely Saturday night in a small town
of the Provinces&mdash;not in gay Paree. At 10:15
I got in a first class compartment and tried to
find a comfortable position in which to sleep. At
2:15 A. M. I had mussed up my clothes considerably,
lost my temper and not slept a wink.
Then we had to change again. The rest of the
morning I sat opposite an American officer, a
queer old fogey, and we tried to kid each other
into thinking we were sleeping, with no success.
Arrived at Bordeaux at 7 A. M., and found that
the train for Pau left immediately, so I missed
out on breakfast, too&mdash;Oh, it was a hectic trip.
My idea of a very unpleasant occupation is that
of a travelling salesman in France.</p>

<p>Ah, &mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>:</p>

<p>Once more I take my pen in hand to lay at
your feet the burdens of an overwrought (how is
that word spelled?) mind, said burdens being
caused by a most unpleasant captain. Just because
I was in Paris for a day and a half without
a permission, he handed me eight days of jail,
and today for nothing at all he hauled me out in
front of the entire division and got quite angered
when I told him in extremely broken French that
I hadn&#8217;t understood a word. But as the jail
doesn&#8217;t mean anything and doesn&#8217;t have to be
served, I am not worrying very much. The afternoon
is misty and there isn&#8217;t a chance of flying,
so he takes particular care that nobody leave
the <i>piste</i> though there is absolutely nothing to do
there, no chance to get warm or comfortable.
Which at least gives me a perfect alibi for poor
penmanship as I&#8217;m sitting in a machine and quite
uncomfortable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>Thoughtless creature, so much like the rest of
your sex, why did you not tell me where Albert
was to be over here, or what he was going to do,
or what service he was in, or at least that he was
in France? I cleverly deduced the latter from
your letter, but did not know where to find him.
When I got your letter I was at Pau, not far
from Bordeaux (Didn&#8217;t I write you or postal-card
you from there?). Afterward at Paris, I
talked to a few very dressed up ensigns with
wings on them somewhere (Walker is the only
name I remember), and they told me that &mdash;&mdash;
was near Bordeaux and in the same group with
themselves. So if, etc., I might have gone to see
the Big Boy.</p>

<p>Yesterday I went to see Billy and another
classmate in an artillery camp the other side of
Paris. They are officers of the U. S. A. and live
as such, which incites in me much envy as I am
still a mere corporal of France and treated with
no more than my due&mdash;not quite as much I sometimes
think. That was the expedition that
brought the jail. Lots and lots of people are
getting over here now. I&#8217;ve seen Heyliger
Church and Kelly Craig who are about to become
aviators somewhere. Porter Guest just became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
breveted (that is, a licensed pilot) and was
considerably seen in Paris shortly after&mdash;no end
of college friends are over here and even an occasional
American girl is seen in Paris. No
friends as yet.</p>

<p>Your letter&mdash;I asked at Morgan Harjes about
Miss &mdash;&mdash; and found that she is at the front in
a hospital, so I can&#8217;t very well find her in Paris.
I&#8217;m sorry as I would very much have liked to.
What one might call permanent people are very
nice to know in Paris. I don&#8217;t know anything
about the front yet, but if I&#8217;m near Miss &mdash;&mdash;&#8217;s
hospital, will try to get acquainted.</p>

<p>What you said about &mdash;&mdash; and his going, I
can pretty well appreciate. There isn&#8217;t a thing
in the world to worry us unmarried and very independent
young men over here. If something
happens to us, it will bother you all back home a
great deal more than us. It&#8217;s very, very true
that women have the heaviest and worst part of
war. I had to write a letter the other day to the
mother of a pal over here who shot himself when
out of his head. A fine pilot and an exceptionally
charming fellow, how I pity his poor mother.
It&#8217;s almost unbelievable the number of women
one sees in black here in France. Thank God, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
can never become that bad at home, for the war
will never get so close to us as it has to the
French.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t the inspiration to compose an imaginative
aeronautic thriller today about the experiences
of a boy aviator. Since last writing, have
finished Nieuport at Avord, went to Pau and
there did acrobacy, came here to Plessis-Belleville
and started Spad, now await assignment to
an <i>escadrille</i> which ought to come within a week.
Haven&#8217;t broken any wood since Blériot days,
but have been a bit more rational and done about
average good work. The preliminary training is
over&mdash;combat training doesn&#8217;t amount to anything
till we get to the front. I&#8217;ll be on a monoplace
machine surely. So in my next you can expect
to hear mighty tales of combating the Boche
at a high altitude. I&#8217;m beginning to hear that
it&#8217;s nothing but a lot of routine work, few combats
and pretty soon a frightful bore: I refuse
to believe it and hang on to romance for all I&#8217;m
worth.</p>

<p>Give my regards to a whole lot of people and
tell them I haven&#8217;t quite given up all hope of a
letter though almost. My friends as a group are
not very strong on letter writing. There are only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
a very few shining exceptions like yourself and
verily they do make of me the heart glad.</p>

<p>Well, I&#8217;m here&mdash;in sight of the front at last.
To date I haven&#8217;t been out there yet and won&#8217;t
for a few days more as they take lots of care of
new pilots and don&#8217;t feed them to the Boche right
away. Probably day after tomorrow the lieutenant
in command will take me out to show me
around the lines and after that I&#8217;ll take my place
in patrols with the others. The work is exclusively
patrolling, establishing as it were a barrage
against German machines and preventing
as far as possible any incursions of the French
lines. As the big attack is over, there is comparatively
little activity. Sometimes one goes for a
whole patrol without being fired on and without
seeing an enemy machine anywhere near the lines.
During the three days I&#8217;ve been here, the group
has accounted for several Boches without any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
losses whatever. Young Bridgeman of the Lafayette
Escadrille had a bullet through his fuselage
just in front of his chest, but suffered no
damage except from fright.</p>

<p>There are several <i>escadrilles</i> in the group, a
<i>groupe de combat</i>&mdash;it is called&mdash;all have Spads
which makes it very nice. The Lafayette, 124,
is of our group and have adjoining barracks,
which makes it very nice (I seem to repeat) for
us lone Americans in French <i>escadrilles</i>. We
drop in there far too often and the first few nights
I used the bed of the famous Bill Thaw&#8217;s roommate,
away on permission. Did I write you that
one morning he brought in Whiskey to wake me
up, and my eye no sooner opened than my head
was buried under the covers. Whiskey is a pet&mdash;a
very large lion cub, which has unfortunately
outgrown its utility as a pet and was sent yesterday,
with its running mate, Soda, to the Zoo at
Paris, to be a regular lion.</p>

<p>They are a very odd crowd&mdash;the members of
the Lafayette Escadrille, a few nice ones and a
bunch of rather roughnecks. Their conversation
is an eye opener for a new arrival. Mostly about
Paris, permissions, and the rue de Braye, but occasionally
about work and that <i>is</i> interesting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Nonchalant doesn&#8217;t express it. When Bridgy
got shot up as mentioned above, they all kidded
the life out of him and when he got the Croix de
Guerre, they had him almost in tears&mdash;just because
he&#8217;s the kiddable kind.</p>

<p>But in talking about the work&mdash;for instance,
Jim Hall: &#8220;I <i>piquéd</i> on him with full motor and
got so darn close to him that when I wanted to
open fire I was so scared of running into him that
I had to yank out of the way and so never fired
a single shot.&#8221; Or Lufberry just mentions in
passing that he got another Boche this morning,
but those &mdash;&mdash; observer people won&#8217;t give him
credit for it. He has fourteen official now and
probably twice as many more never allowed him.
Some days ago during the attack he had seven
fights in one day, brought down six of them and
got credit for one. Which must be discouraging.</p>

<h3>XIV</h3>


<p class="right">November 5, 1917.</p>

<p>Well &mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>:</p>

<p>Here I find myself writing to you without
waiting for the usual two or three months to
elapse. Do you realize that it was over five and
a half months ago that I left my native land? It
doesn&#8217;t seem near so long to me. Just at present
I have about thirteen hours a day to write, read
the <i>Washington Star</i> and <i>New York Times</i>, eat
an occasional meal (we only get two over here,
worse luck), build fires in the stove and stroll for
exercise. The rest of the time is devoted to sleep.
A terribly hard life that of an aviator on the
western front! No <i>appels</i> (meaning roll calls),
discipline or inspections. Only, if there should
happen to be a good day, one might be wanted to
fly a bit. So far (I have only been out here a
week) we have had perfectly ideal aviators&#8217;
weather&mdash;nice low misty clouds about 300 or
400 feet up, which quite prevent aerial activity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and yet one is not bothered by mud or depressed
by rain. In the morning, one awakes, pokes his
head out the window, says &#8220;What lo! more luck,
a nice light <i>brouillard</i>&#8221; and closes the window
for a few hours more of sleep. Really I have
done more resting the past week than most people
do in a lifetime!</p>

<p>To get statistical, I finished up at Pau (from
where I sent to you a letter, <i>n&#8217;est-ce-pas?</i>) a
month ago, and then spent two very unpleasant
weeks at Plessis-Belleville near Paris, at the big
dépôt for the front, waiting to be sent to an <i>escadrille</i>,
with nothing to do but a little desultory
flying, nurse the system, food, weather, lodging,
discipline, etc. Eventually my turn came and,
with another American, I was dispatched to Esc.
SPA 84, where we arrived after the usual delay
passing through Paris. That&#8217;s one nice thing
about this country: all roads lead to Paris. Sent
from one place to another, it is a safe wager that
one goes <i>via</i> Paris, and always takes forty-eight
hours there and gets permission for it if he can.
There are a few Frenchmen there still, but on the
streets one sees almost entirely American, British
or British Colonial officers&mdash;occasionally a
French aviator and of course clouds of sweet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
innocent young things&mdash;yes? Nearly all of my
classmates are over here and get to Paris every
once in a while, so all I have to do is to sit at the
Café de la Paix and if I wait long enough, some
one I know will surely come along.</p>

<p>Well, to get back on the track, we eventually
found ourselves members of le-dit Esc. SPA 84&mdash;one
esc. of a <i>groupe de chasse</i>, which means that
we will have patrolling work to do mainly and
not protection of observation or photo machines&mdash;which
they tell me, is fortunate. Also we have
good machines&mdash;the best there are, which might
not have happened had we been sent to another
type of <i>escadrille</i>&mdash;purely good fortune. The
much advertised Lafayette Esc. No. 124, is a
member of the same group, is located near us and
does the same work, which makes it much pleasanter
for lone Americans. We use their stove
and tea of an afternoon quite freely as our quarters
are new and not fixed up. But say, when we
do get going, everybody will be in to see us.
We&#8217;ll have a cosy, beautifully wallpapered room
clustering around a stove.... The men of 124
are a rather good crowd&mdash;not much different
from any crowd of Americans, a bit rough but
most of it affected because they&#8217;re away from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
home, very hospitable, rather daredevil or hard-hearted
(whichever you wish to call it&mdash;the way
they talk about each other&#8217;s narrow escapes, coming
falls, the mistakes or misfortunes of departed
brothers, and there have been several) and very
mixed, centering around Lieutenant Bill Thaw,
of the French Army, who impresses me as being
very much of a leader and an unusually fine type.
There is one tough nut from a Middle Western
Siwash-like college, who was probably still ungraduated
at 27, and a quiet, innocent looking
kid who seems to have just got out of prep school;
of course, the tough guy tears the little one.
Then there are a couple of old Légionnaires&mdash;rather
superior and terribly tired of war, quite
unenthusiastic, but I dare say congenial when
one gets under their hide or fills it full of booze.
And Jim Hall, the author chap&mdash;quiet, reserved,
almost simple in his lack of affectation and boyish
in his enthusiasm. (Gad, how he wants to get
his Boche and he almost thinks he did the other
day, but it wasn&#8217;t verified. He followed him
down from 1,500 to 200 metres, shooting all the
time, and thinks he must have brought him
down)....</p>

<p>Did I mention above that I am at present in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the status, practically, of a non-flying member?
On arriving at the front, one is not rushed
straightway to the cannon&#8217;s mouth, but rather
allowed to get acclimated a bit first, to have a few
preliminary voyages to look around, etc. During
my week here, there has been little flying and
I haven&#8217;t even seen the front, only heard the guns
occasionally. Of my three flights, two were just
short <i>tours de champs</i>. But the other: never in
my wildest Blériot days did I do a wilder one.
Coming from Pau where I had tried some stunts,
I thought I was a bit of an acrobat, second only
to Navarre, Guynemer and a few others. So arriving
at a safe height, I started to go through
the <i>répertoire</i>. First came a loop which got
around to the vertical point&mdash;a quarter turn and
then slipped, ending in a vertical corkscrew or
climbing barrel turn or whatever you want to
call it&mdash;then losing momentum and just naturally
tumbling. I didn&#8217;t know what was going on&mdash;only
that it wasn&#8217;t right; they told me afterward.
After that came the <i>renversements</i> and
vertical turns, etc., and not a thing came out.
Lost&mdash;I got lost thirty times and had to hunt
all around to see where I was. Nothing went
right and I kept getting madder and madder and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
poorer and poorer. They were all laughing down
below and wondering what was going on up there.
Eventually the party ended&mdash;one of the old
pilots told me that that one flight equalled about
thirty hours over the lines and the commander
advised against a repetition of the performance,
and so I went and lay down. Two hours later I
began to feel that perhaps I could stand on my
feet again; did you ever have <i>mal-de-mer</i>?</p>

<p>So now I really ought to begin to learn something,
having acquired that all essential first
knowledge of ignorance, which all good students
should have. And in the meantime perhaps I
shall go and combat the Wily Hun. Said W.
Hun need not worry about my bothering him if
he doesn&#8217;t keep fooling around under my nose till
I&#8217;m ashamed not to go after him. I&#8217;m not bloodthirsty
a bit, especially till I learn to fly, and the
lack of combats isn&#8217;t going to keep me awake
nights for a while yet.</p>

<p>But the bunkmate seems to have gone to bed;
it&#8217;s almost ten&mdash;a most unprecedented hour for
me to be up, so the end approaches. Kind remembrances
as usual&mdash;use your discretion and
don&#8217;t forget that long tale of &#8220;Washington Social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>

<p>Addenda:</p>

<p>Your letter on just arriving home has been
with me some time and truly brought joy to my
heart in this desolate land. (The &#8220;desolate&#8221; seems
to fit in though not applying to the land in question
at all.)...</p>

<p>Chester Snow is aviating under the auspices
of the U. S. Government. I last heard from him
in a postal written on the last stop of the last
triangle of his brevet, so he should be through
training before much longer. The other Chester,
Bassett, is still at Avord, so I can not deliver
your note to him....</p>

<p>Your other question referred to the army I am
in, and is easily answered by saying that the
U.S.A. has as yet done nothing but talk about
taking us over. &#8220;Us&#8221; now refers to upward of
200 Americans, I think, either in French <i>escadrilles</i>
or well advanced in the French schools.
Constantly all summer, we have been &#8220;going to
be transferred in two weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>Another quiet, non-flying, slightly rainy day
has passed. This isn&#8217;t perhaps the most ideal
spot in the world for a winter resort, from
the point of view of comforts, but, considering
the ease of conscience because one is not in
the position to be called <i>embusqué</i>, it is really not
half bad. It&#8217;s starting to rain again rather harder;
I wonder if the roof will keep out water?</p>

<span class="indentright2">Evening.</span></p>

<p>You know November in France. I&#8217;ve been
here almost two weeks now and am still <i>à l&#8217;entrainement</i>,
that is, I haven&#8217;t started in to do any
regular work yet. Only five times have I been
able to fly in two weeks. But I&#8217;ve got my own
machine, and mechanic, everything is in order
and I&#8217;ve been assigned to a patrol the last two
mornings when it rained. Tomorrow again at
8:50 with four others&mdash;patrol for one hour and
fifty minutes at about 15,000 feet, back and forth
over our sector, sometimes over our own lines,
sometimes in Bochie. I&#8217;m getting very impatient
to get started. In what few flights I&#8217;ve
had, I&#8217;ve been working on acrobacy a bit and am
gradually learning a few simple things; twice I
stayed up a little too long and had to lie down a
few hours afterward, almost seasick.</p>

<p>I like Spa 84 very much indeed. The Frenchmen
there are much more regular fellahs than
most of those I&#8217;ve been with in the schools.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>Wertheimer, a sergeant, is a sort of informal
and unadmitted chief of the <i>sous-officiers</i>. It is
he that speaks English and has helped us a lot in
getting settled, etc. Very much of a gentleman
he is, and understands a bit Anglo-Saxon customs
and eccentricities, always gay and an indefatigable
worker. We have all been arranging
the one big room of our barracks&mdash;dining room,
reading room, and probably eventually American
bar. The walls are covered with green cloth,
green paper (of two different shades and neither
quite the same as the cloth), red cloth (on top as
a sort of frieze) and red paper. The ceiling is
done in white cloth to keep in heat and lighten the
room. A monumental task it has been, especially
as materials are hard to get and expensive.
Wertem (as Wertheimer is called) and Deborte
have done most of the work. Deborte is also
<i>chef de popote</i>, which means housekeeper, and a
very efficient man. For four francs per day we
are fed amazingly well, especially when one realizes
that we are near the front in a country which
has had three years of war. Deborte hasn&#8217;t the
pleasantest manner in the world at times, but
usually is very agreeable, willing to tell me things
about flying or the <i>escadrille</i>, always ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
work, and a dependable man in the air. And
Verber who rooms with Wertem,&mdash;he speaks a
little English, has a great deal of trouble understanding
it, but is picking up. Wears a monocle
all the time because he&#8217;s got a bum eye, carries a
stick and has an extremely eccentric appearance,
but withal is very agreeable and a very valuable
man. He has the habit of taking long trips all
alone far into Germany just to see what is going
on. Pinot is the name of the little roly-poly chap
everybody calls Bul-Bul, who used to be a mechanic
and now is a very good, merry pilot. He
has a great <i>pension</i> toward Pinard, is violently
but not at all objectionably non-aristocratic, is
forever laughing or kidding some one, walks on
his hands to amuse people, and is the delight of
all the <i>mécanos</i>. Demeuldre is a very quiet sort
of school boy type who has been a pilot of biplanes
and reconnaissance machines for a long
time. He came to the escadrille recently with a
record of two Boches as pilot of a biplane (that
is, his machine gun man did the shooting and they
both get credit), and a few days ago brought
down a German in flames, his first as <i>pilote de
chasse</i>. There are two others away on permission,
whom I don&#8217;t know yet.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright2"><span class="smcap">Somewhere in France,</span></span><br />
November 13, 1917.</p>

<p>Dear Father:</p>

<p>Campbell was in the Lafayette Escadrille and
they are a member of the same group as Spa 84,
so I have asked them about him. He was on a
patrol with another chap, they attacked some
Boches and when it was over the other chap was
alone. Campbell was brought down in German
territory and so reported missing. I believe that
the chap he was with has seen and talked to
Campbell&#8217;s father or some close relative since.
Another chap named Bulkley was brought down
in similar circumstances about the first of September.
Ten days ago, word was received from
the American Embassy that he had communicated
with them, a prisoner in Germany. There
are many similar cases, where men brought down
with crippled machines or wounded escape destruction
by a miracle. The only sure thing is
when a machine goes down in flames or is seen to
lose a wing or two.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>For instance, there are two officers in the group
who are in the best of health and daily working.
Several months ago, they were on patrol together,
collided in the air. One cut the tail rigging
completely off the other and they separated,
one without a tail and the other with various
parts of a tail mixed among the cables and struts
of one side of his machine. They both landed in
France, one on his wheels followed by a <i>capotage</i>
or somersault turnover, the other quite completely
upside down. Then a term in the hospital and
back they are again. Kenneth Marr, an American,
had the commands of both his tail controls
cut in a combat, the rudder and elevator, leaving
him nothing but the <i>aileron</i>&mdash;the lateral balance
control and the motor. He landed with only a
skinned nose for casualties and got a decoration
for it.</p>

<p>Another chap in an attack on captive balloons,
<i>drachens</i>, dove for something like 10,000 feet
<i>vertically</i> and with <i>full motor</i> on, thereby gaining
considerable speed as you can imagine. He
came right on top of the balloon, shot and to keep
from hitting it, yanked as roughly as he could,
flattening out his dive in the merest fraction of a
second. Imagine the strain on the machine!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
When he got home, all the wires had several
inches sag in them; the metal connections of the
cables in the struts and wood of the wings had bit
into the wood enough to give the sag.</p>

<p>Machines are built to stand immense pressure
on the under side of the wings. In some acrobatic
manoeuvres I was trying the other day, I
made mistakes and caused the machine to stall
and then fall in such a way that the full weight
was supported by the <i>upper surface</i>&mdash;by the
wires which in most machines are supposed merely
to support the weight of the wings when the
machine is on the ground. Yes, the Spad is a
well built machine, the nearest thing to perfection
in point of strength, speed and climbing power
I&#8217;ve seen yet. Of course it&#8217;s heavy and that&#8217;s
why they put 150-230 HP in them. The other
school, that of a light machine with a light motor&mdash;depending
for its success on lack of weight
rather than excess of power, may supplant the
heavier machine in time&mdash;I can&#8217;t tell. So, as
anyone who knows has said right along, there is
a long way to go in the development of the J N
or even the little tri-plane, before American built
planes get to the front. Of the bombing game,
I don&#8217;t know anything at all.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>Yesterday there was a <i>revue</i> here in honor of
Guynemer, and decorations for the pilots of the
group who had won them. Three Americans received
the Croix de Guerre&mdash;members of the Lafayette
Escadrille. Lufberry, the American ace,
carried the American flag presented to the <i>escadrille</i>
by Mrs. McAdoo and the employees of the
Treasury Department&mdash;besides the two aviation
emblems of France. He was called to receive
his decoration &#8220;for having in the course of one
day held seven combats, descended one German
plane in flames, and forced five others to land behind
their lines&#8221; (which means that he is officially
credited with one, his thirteenth, and that the
other five though probably brought down, do not
count for him because there were not the necessary
witnesses required by the French regulation).
Being the bearer of the flag, he was a very
worried man to know what to do with the flag
when he should go up to get his medal, till one
of the fellows in 124 (the Lafayette) came to
his rescue.</p>

<p>For a military <i>revue</i> it was decidedly amusing.
Aviators are not very military. The chief of one
of the <i>escadrilles</i> was commissioned to command
the mechanics who are plain soldiers with rifles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and steel helmets for the occasion. He is a bit
of a clown and amused the entire gathering, kidding
with the officers. The pilots of each of the
five <i>escadrilles</i> were in more or less formation,
most of them with hands in their pockets for it
was chilly, and presenting a mixture of uniforms
unparalleled in its heterogeneity. Every branch
of the service represented and endless personal
ideas in dress. Because of the occasion, <i>repos</i> has
been granted to the entire group for the afternoon,
another group taking over our patrols. So
that after the <i>revue</i>, everyone had the afternoon
to waste&mdash;a sunny day which is quite unusual this
month. Within a half hour, every machine that
was in working order was in the air&mdash;forming
into groups and then off for the lines, just looking
for trouble&mdash;a voluntary patrol they call it.
Which opened my eyes a bit to the spirit in the
French service after three years of war.</p>

<p>Word from Paris that those Americans in the
French service who have demanded their release
to join the U. S. A. have obtained that release&mdash;which
probably means that all we wait for now
... is the commissions.</p>

<p>This afternoon I took another trip with one of
the old pilots to look over the sector. We stayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
over France and didn&#8217;t get into trouble although
there were lots of Boches around. Hope to get
really started soon.... An amusing one this
morning: two pilots from the group were on
patrol and attacked a single German about two
kilometres behind the German lines. They completely
outmanoeuvred him, he got cold feet and
started for the French lines, giving himself up.
The funniest part about it is that the machine
gun of one of the attackers was jammed and he
couldn&#8217;t possibly have hurt the Boche&mdash;just had
the nerve to stay and throw a bluff. They came
back to camp just before dark this evening, one
of them flying the German machine and the other
guarding him in a Spad. The machine is an
Albatross monoplane (biplane)&mdash;finished in
silver with big black crosses on the wings and tail&mdash;a
really beautiful thing. It flew around camp
for several minutes before landing. It is the second
machine that has been scared down since I&#8217;ve
been out here.</p>

<p>At present things are hopelessly slow on account
of bad weather, so I have a good deal of
time to write and naught to write of. I still am
waiting for my baptism of active service which is
assigned for each day and held up on account of
fog, low clouds or rain. In the afternoon it usually
lifts a little, not enough to fly over the lines,
but sufficient to permit a little <i>vol d&#8217;entrainement</i>,
a practice flight around the field. I&#8217;ve been taking
every chance to learn to fly, practicing reversements,
vertically banked turns, 90° nose
dives, etc. Two day ago, we had a very interesting
mimic combat in the air. The Boche machine,
which has been captured, and a Spad, both
driven by very clever pilots, manoeuvred for position
during fifteen or twenty minutes at 1,000
feet or less, back and forth over the field, doing
almost every possible thing in the air&mdash;changing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
direction with incredible rapidity, diving, climbing,
wing slipping, upside down dives&mdash;everything
under the sun.</p>

<p>Two of them were at it again today in two
Spads, just manoeuvring. What a lot there is to
learn! When I got through acrobacy at Pau, I
had the impression that that kind of stuff was relatively
easy&mdash;now I know different. For the
present I&#8217;m working on the system of try one
thing at a time&mdash;get that fairly well and then
commence another. And small doses&mdash;ten or
fifteen minutes for an acrobatic flight, not more,
because one can easily get dangerously sick in a
very short time. Not that there is any particular
peril in getting ill in the air, only it&#8217;s beastly uncomfortable!</p>

<p>The rumor at the Lafayette Escadrille this
evening is that they have been at last transferred.
Of course they had similar rumors many times
before. For myself I am becoming rather indifferent,
very well satisfied here except for weather,
and getting what I came over here for.</p>

<p>Father mentioned something about a monitor&#8217;s
job (after I had had experience at the front).
My present inclination is decidedly against the
idea. There is no job in the world I like less to
think of and there are plenty of people who want
to get comfortably settled in the rear, so let them,
say I, and may they enjoy it. It is not a very
pleasant job. As a retirement after a period of
service at the front it is another matter. Of all
people I can think of I have the smallest right to
an <i>embusqué</i> job at present&mdash;so here I hope to
stay. Whether I fly with an American or French
uniform I don&#8217;t care very much at the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
moment. I had rather get a Boche than any commission
in the army, but one cannot always tell
about the future; perhaps after a few good scares
I&#8217;ll be ready to jump at a monitor&#8217;s job.</p>

<p>I tried to give you all some idea of the strength
of a Spad in a letter a while ago. At home people
speak of a factor of safety, meaning the number
of times stronger the machine is than is necessary
for plain flying. The Spad is made so that
a man can&#8217;t bust it no matter what he does in the
air&mdash;dive as far and as fast as he can and stop as
brutally as he can&mdash;it stands the racket. Of
course, motors do stop and if it happens over a
mountain range&mdash;well, that&#8217;s just hard luck.</p>

<p>Have had a few patrols since last I wrote.
One at a high height, 4,000-4,500 metres, considerably
above the clouds which almost shut out the
ground below, wonderfully beautiful sight but
beastly cold, and a couple when the clouds were
low and solid. The patrol stays at just the
height of the clouds, hiding in them and slipping
out again to look around. If it gets below, the
enemy anti-aircraft guns pepper it whenever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
near the lines and at a low altitude that is rather
awkward&mdash;so the patrol shows itself as little as
possible.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s lots of sport to try to keep with the patrol:
be behind the chief of patrol, see him disappear
and then bump into a fog bank, a low-hanging
cloud and not see a darn thing. Then dive down
out of the cloud wondering whether the other
guy is right underneath or not; shoot out of the
cloud and see him maybe 500 yards away going
at right angles. Then bank up and turn around
fast and give her the gear&mdash;full speed to catch
up and so on. See a Boche regulating artillery
fire, start to manoeuvre into range and zip! he&#8217;s
out of sight in the clouds and the next you see he
is beating it far back of his lines. Not very dangerous
this weather, but lots of fun.</p>

<p>Dear &mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>:</p>

<p>Thanks for the merry, merry wishes for the
gay Xmas season and I&#8217;ll try to remember them
when the day comes along. Sundays and holidays
are not very much noticed here at the front,
except that on Sunday the mechanics all get full
of <i>pinard</i> and song and devilment&mdash;the <i>pinard</i>
(meaning cheap red ink used by the French in
place of drinking water) is of course responsible
for the two latter. In the villages, the entire male
population likewise drinks much wine and everyone&mdash;man,
woman, child, dog, and domestic animal,
parades the streets&mdash;dressed up all like a
picture book (applying mostly to women and
children). Occasionally they cross the sidewalk,
but the middle of the street is <i>the</i> place to walk.</p>

<p>One Sunday, I went to church, the first time
since last Easter, I think, to attend the mass
given for the departed brethren of the <i>escadrille</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
The chapel is in a little town a few miles from our
camp. Along in the Middle Ages or anyway a
long time ago, there was a beautiful cathedral
there&mdash;now the town is insignificantly small.
The front of the cathedral is standing almost in
its entirety and the walls for a little way back,
dwindling down into glorious ruins and finally
tumbled masses of rock and stray pillars. Where
the back wall once stood, there now runs a little
brook (I almost called it bubbling, but it happens
to be an unusually dead and not over-clean
little stream). The chapel is a place about as big
as a minute, snuggling in beside the big front
wall of the ancient cathedral. The service was
meaningless to me&mdash;what wasn&#8217;t Latin was
French. I followed the fellow in front of me
and didn&#8217;t miss it once on the getting up and
down (fortunately, <i>militaires</i> don&#8217;t have to kneel,
I suppose because they appreciate the fact that
most of them wear breeches made by French
tailors).</p>

<p>But they fooled me once. What must have
been the village belle (what a village!) passed a
little button bag affair in baby blue ribbon,
and gathered up the shekels. I dropped mine
in and horror&mdash;here comes the young sister with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
an identical bag and asks for more and I was unprepared
and had to turn her down amidst my
blushes. I thought she was working on the other
side of the house as we used to do at evening service
and to this day I don&#8217;t know why they took
up two collections though it has been explained
to me three times in French.</p>

<p>Have had some very pleasant trips over the
German border (present, not 1914), have
watched a few Archies bursting at a safe distance
away and seen some specks which were Boche
planes, but am not ready to write a book yet.
Yesterday morning we had the first sortie at 6:45
daylight. A solid bank of clouds over the camp
here at 2,000 metres. The lines are parallel to a
river and a few kilometres north. The edge of
the cloud bank was over the river, sharp as if cut
by a knife and all Germany cloudless. We
slipped out from under it and back on top just
in time to see the sun get over the horizon&mdash;almost
as far away as Rheims, which we just cannot
see. The river and canal were just silver
ribbons on a black cloth stretching for miles due
east. Under us we could make out the ground
on one side and the clouds on the other, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the west the cloud bank continued to follow the
lines, a gloriously beautiful panorama. The
cloud bank stayed nearly the same the two hours
we were up. From a distance above or below,
a cloud is just a big, soft, quiet cushion of cotton
fluff, but near to it is a seething, irregular, tossing,
furious jumble of mist.</p>

<p>We saw a few Boches, far behind their lines.
An hour after we were back, they said that Lufbery
had just brought down another machine, his
15th, in flames. He was using a new machine
and the gun was not properly regulated&mdash;seven
balls were in each blade of the propeller, yet it
held together and brought him home. I was
down at the Lafayette hangars talking to Bill
Thaw, and here comes the mighty man in a hurry
from reporting his flight. With fire in his eye
he got in his old machine and off again for the
lines. At noon he had brought down another,
which hasn&#8217;t yet been officially <i>homologué</i>, but is
none the less sure for that. Thaw brought down
one this morning. They are doing well, these
men of the American Escadrille&mdash;still French,
however, though shortly to be transferred, we
hear.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>May your Xmas be a happy one, and the new
year and those to follow bring you ever better
fortune than the last one.</p>

<p>Dear &mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a>:</p>

<p>I got the Sunday <i>Star</i> a few days ago and
there was that same old picture and &mdash;&mdash;
staring me in the face! A very nice write-up, I
thought it. What a bunch of big-wigs they did
gather together! We packed up bag and baggage
yesterday and flew off to a new place, and
here we are waiting for the baggage to catch up.
I have grave fears that there may be some fighting
one of these days, and if so, I think it will be
about time for me to get out of this war. Cheery
oh!</p>

December 8, 1917.</p>

<p>Yesterday we were awakened at 6 and told
that we were going to move out, bag and baggage
at 2. So now as new barracks were not
ready we came down here last night and have
been seeing the sights of the town since. It is
full of Americans, ambulances, doctors, Y. M.
C. A. workers, everything but fighting men which
I trust we&#8217;ll see before long.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE FINAL COMBAT</h2></div>


<p>On December 12, while on patrol, Stuart
Walcott met a German biplane carrying two
men. Three cable reports agree that he shot
down and destroyed this machine about two and
a half miles within the German lines. He then
started back for the French lines and was overtaken
by four Albatross German planes. He
was overcome and his machine went down in a
nose dive within the German lines, it being assumed
that either he was shot or his machine
disabled.</p>

<p>There was still a hope that he might have
escaped death. Inquiries were at once instituted
through the American Red Cross and the International
Red Cross, with the result that on January
7 a cable came from the International Red
Cross stating that it was reported in Germany
that S. Walcott was brought down during the
afternoon of December 12 near Saint Souplet,
and that he was killed by the fall.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">STUART WALCOTT</h2></div>

<p class="center">[A biographical note written by his father.]</p>


<p>Benjamin Stuart Walcott was sturdy and
self-reliant as a boy and very early developed
strong personal initiative, good sense and courage.
I find in my notebook under an entry of
July 6, 1905, a few days before Stuart&#8217;s ninth
birthday, that with him and his brother Sidney
I had measured a section of over 10,000 feet in
thickness of rock with dip compass and rod in
northern Montana, and that that night we slept
out on the Continental Divide after a sandwich
apiece for supper. On July 16, &#8220;Went up the
Gordon Creek with Stuart and cut a few trees
out of the trail.&#8221; And on the next day, &#8220;Stuart
assisted me in collecting fossils from the Middle
Cambrian Rocks.&#8221;</p>

<p>In 1906 Stuart helped in gathering Cambrian
fossils in central Montana, and in recognition of
his effective work one of the new species of shells
was named after him, <i>Micromitra</i> (<i>Paterina</i>)
<i>stuarti</i>.</p>





<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>He also assisted in British Columbia in geological
work during the summer of 1907, and in
1908, when twelve years old, he was placed with
one packer in charge of a pack train operating in
what is now the Glacier Park, Montana, and in
southern British Columbia. On this trip one
morning I heard faint rifle shots, and upon overtaking
the pack train found Stuart shooting
away with a 22 gauge rifle at a grizzly bear, which
was some distance down the slope below the trail.
On reminding him of the danger, he said he
wanted to drive the bear away to prevent a stampede
of the animals.</p>

<p>Both at home and in school his actions were
largely influenced by a determination first to
know what was the right thing to do, and guided
by this habit, when it looked as though the United
States would enter the European War, he decided
that it was his duty to take part in it.
When the Lusitania was sunk he felt strongly
that the United States should take a positive
stand in favor of the freedom of the seas, that the
rights of Americans should be protected even if
it meant war, and he was ready to fight for it.</p>

<p>In common with the majority of the youth of
America, he had the feeling that it was a patriotic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
duty and privilege to offer personal service to the
Nation when its ideals and motives were assailed
by a foreign foe. He first offered his services to
the Signal Corps and received a temporary appointment.
Realizing that training as an expert
aviator could be more quickly obtained in France
than in this country, he went to France and enlisted
in the French Army with the expectation
of being transferred later to the American
forces. This would have been done prior to his
being shot down within the German lines on December
12, had he not been awaiting action by
the United States Aviation Service in France in
examining and arranging for the transfer of the
American aviators in the French Army to the
service of the United States.</p>

<p>Throughout his life the dominating thought
was to be of positive service wherever he might
be placed. At the same time he was thoroughly
a boy and enjoyed a frolic and fun as much as
any one of his companions.</p>

<p>He prepared for college at the Taft School,
expecting to enter Yale, and passed the examinations
for that university before he was sixteen.
Upon further consideration he selected Princeton,
largely because of the preceptorial method<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
of training, and was a senior when he decided to
enter the service of his country.</p>

<p>Stuart was an unusually well balanced boy and
youth; his moral convictions were sound, definite,
and expressed by action rather than words.</p>
